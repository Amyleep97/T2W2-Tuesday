# Base

- Number of digits that the counting system or number system uses 
- For example, we (humans) use decimal number system which has 1- digits (0-9), so, the base of decimal number system is 10
- All other numbers are combinations of these 10 digits.
- When we run out of digits in one place, we move to the next place.
- ..., 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ... 19, 20, 21, ... 29, ... 99, 100, 101, ...
  
# Binary
